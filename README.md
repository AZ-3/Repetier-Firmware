## !! 24.03.2017: We permanently moved to the RF1000community. 
There are now two Branches: community_development and community_stable.  
You should use [community_stable](https://github.com/RF1000community/Repetier-Firmware).  
Within the branch community_development we work from time to time. Whenever some new function is good we will move it to stable.  

## Please look for and download the Firmware there, not here!

# This is my personal Testingversion. I did implement an Ultimaker 3-function for myself because I need an extra Z-Offset for the right Extruder which is springloaded on my experimental E3D-Hotend.  
  
  
  
Additional features of this mod (compared to community edt.):  
- Tip-Down-Support for right Extruder T1  
- Digit-Compensation (Improved Z-Compensation: The bed is leveling out the height-changes due to force on the dms-sensors.)
