* This Version is tested on RF2000 only, but should work on RF1000 as well.

* introduceing a new command M3901 to configure M3900
* M116 Temperature tolerance changed to 2Â°K
* Z_OVERRIDE_MAX = 1.0mm, instead of 0.5mm
* introduceing a new command M3902 to fix a HeatBeds Hole within the HBS Matrix.
* introduceing a new command M3903 to configure a very slow heat bed temperature decrease
* introduceing a new command M355 to configure MOS FET X19 (Wessix-Licht-Mod)

## !! 29.12.2016: Project is Work in Progress and untested changes are pending !! Fixing copiler warnings, but untested!

## !! 31.12.2016: As in V 1.35 i saw crashes when outputting objects. Once after calibrating, once after printing 1h. This needs to be tested and compared to the original V1.35.
-> Compile with Arduino.cc 1.6.5, otherwise the OutputObject-Command is not 100% stable at Commands::waitUntilEndOfAllMoves();
