## We permanently moved to the RF1000community. 
There are now two Branches: community_development and community_stable.  
You should use [community_stable](https://github.com/RF1000community/Repetier-Firmware).  
In community_development you find the released version of the mod which should be working good.
In community_stable you find a bit older version about which nobody complained for a long time.

## Please look for and download the Firmware from RF1000community!

# This is my personal Testingspace.
